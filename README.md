# -JavaBinarySearchTreeLibrary
Java implementation of a Binary Search Tree with insert, search, and traversal operations.

This project provides a Java implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST). A BST is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, and the left child is less than the parent, while the right child is greater than the parent.
Features

    Insertion: Add elements to the BST while maintaining the binary search tree property.
    Search: Find a specific element in the BST.
    Traversal: Perform inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals of the BST.
    Maximum Element: Find the maximum element in the BST.
